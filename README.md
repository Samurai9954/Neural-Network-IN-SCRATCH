# Neural-Network-IN-SCRATCH
Yes, this is a dumb idea, yes im wasting my life, but who cares?

I will create a fully functioning, neural network from SCRATCH IN SCRATCH

This will be a fun ride, so if you want to help me, join this server in discord - blabla



My goal? to create a fully functioning feed-forward neural network in scratch, that can classify images lol XD
             
             
this is gonna be tough, but hey im in quarentine anyways so YOLO
